          Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that’s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. We have probably been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence, along with terms like machine learning and Natural language processing (NLP). Especially if you work in a company that processes hundreds, or even thousands of customer interactions every day. Analyzing vast amounts of data from social media posts, emails, chats, open-ended survey responses, and more, is not an easy task, and less so when delegated to humans alone. That’s why many are excited about the implications artificial intelligence could have on their day-to-day tasks, as well as on businesses as a whole. AI-powered text analysis uses a wide variety of methods or algorithms to process language naturally, one of which is topic analysis – used to automatically detect topics from texts.
